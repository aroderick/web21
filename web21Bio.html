 Mistakes are great. </br>
They help you find the right solution.</br>
I am, James Hindermeier. </br>
I saw a post on linkedIn, with a fun, beautifully rendered illustration. The author of the post, jokingly wrote,  illustration couldn’t really be considered “work’. 
This might be true if you just illustrated anything you desired, in any form, medium or style that moved you.
<p>
As an illustrator you’re rendering someone else’s idea or concept, about a business, product, or concept that they know inside out,  on a conception that they haven’t figured out exactly, what it  should be or look like. </br>
They want you to grab their enthusiasm, figure out what they want, then bring the solution all life in an exciting, fantastica; visual concept.</br>
And they wanted it 3 days before they even called.
</p>
<p>
Illustration can be lot’s of fun, rewarding, in some cases really #@!'n hard.
</p>
<p>
If you’re looking for a person that knows everything right from the top of their heard, can do things right the first time, you’re looking for an idiot unicorn. </br>
 You  seek a persona who will give to you the same answers one, two, five, ten years from now because they believe they already know the  resolution.
</p>
<p>
You want someone with the investigative skills to find 5 versions of the answer on the internet. Someone who if you frustrate enough with answers too long and complex to suit the problem, will conceive and devise their own solution. <br>
Look no further.

<p>
I came to a coding solution,  in one long  line of  math and logic,  that others were writing pages to solve. It frustrated me and I was not convinced it needed that much effort to solve such a simple issue.

I am James Hindermeier and I create.
Illustration, design, web design & construction.</br>
I see. I devise my own interpretation, then I mold and actualize a new solution.
