   	I am, James Hindermeier. </br>
I bring to life,  illustration and design to web and  print. </br>
I've worked internationally and locally, for major corporations, government agencies, through advertising firms around and throughout Vancouver British Columbia Canada. </br>
I’ve achieved magazine awards, several New York, One Awards, Vancouver advertising, Lotus Awards and web awards.  These could mark the level of my ability. </br>
I'n not about awards. </br>
I give my all, </br>
I do good work.</br>
I have multiple  styles of illustration. There is set character, confidence,  to my art, whatever style I use. </br>
I seek to provide what you’re looking for.
Some of the best work I've ever done has come from good collaboration with talented agency art direction. </br>
What I make and create is for you. It may win awards. I make it to your specifications.</br>
Sometimes just practical, always useful. My art is not for my glorification (But sometimes it can make me look and feel pretty  good).
</p>
<p>
I create web sites. I created and constructed this great web site. I work with Grid but I can also create sites with WordPress.
</p>
<p>
I"ve seen more, done more, I bring more.</br>
Draw your own conclusions. </br>
Better yet; </br>
